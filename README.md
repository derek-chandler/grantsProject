# Grants.gov Report Generator

## Description

This project generates US Government grant reports based on data provided by [grants.gov](https://www.grants.gov/). The user specifies the date-range of grants that they wish to include, then the program will generate a neatly formatted Microsoft Word document complete with a bookmarked table of contents. 

---

## Requirements

 * [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or above
 * Ability to install Python packages with [Python pip](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#requirements-for-installing-packages)  
 * All python packages in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/derek-chandler/grantsProject/blob/main/requirements.txt)
   * If you are using Windows, you can safely skip this step as the provided `GrantParser.bat` file will automatically install these packages.

To view the generated report properly, Microsoft Word is required.

---

## Usage

 * Windows:
    1. Install requirements as instructed above
    2. Execute the program by double clicking `GrantParser.bat`
 * Linux/macOS
    1. Install all requirements as instructed above
       * You may need to install tkinter on your system to be able to launch the GUI 
    2. Execute the program with `python GrantsParserXML.py`
    
 3. Choose a date range with the provided calendar GUI.
    * The default date range is from the past 7 days to the current date inclusive.
 4. Once a date range is selected, click **Confirm** and a report will be generated

When the program finishes, `GrantsReport_YYYY-MM-DD.docx` is generated and will be placed in the program's folder.

If you wish to generate another report *in the same day*, please rename or move the generated report out of the program's root directory

# Documentation


## Overview of driver `GrantsParserXML.py` 

MAIN Object

* Defines class Grant and init as well as all printed parameters in the grant report (IE Agency Code, Agency Name, etc)
* More information in *GrantsParserXML.py* section below.

MAIN Functions

* Defines the parameters printed in each individual grant report
* Defines grantDictionaryAdd that creates a dictionary using the distinctAgency as a key and the grants as values

Downloading

* Calls to the `GrantDownloader.py` file for it to begin downloading and extracting the most recent zipped XML.
* More information in *GrantDownloader.py* section below.

UI Begin

* Contains all UI Elements used for user to select date range of the grant report
* UI uses variable today and variable last_week to automatically select the default date range of the past 7 days
* Basic Settings defines the opening root of the tkinter UI panel as well as some settings such as the program title (root.title), UI Panel Icon (.ico for windows, .xbm for linux), and panel size (root.geometry)
* Line 227 - 231 defines the format of the UI frame, setting a "TOP" and "BOTTOM" of the UI panel in order to divide the placement of the ui elements
* my_toplabel sets a label value at the top of the UI panel while the .pack addition allows for the label to have padding and be placed within the top of the UI
* DateEntry fields set the two entry fiels with a popup calendar alongside the parameters of the calendar
* def grab_date collects the user's selected date from the DateEntry panels and sets an error popup if the user selects an improper date range (if the first date is AFTER the second date)
* def downloadxml is used within the multithreading in order to allow the XML download / unzip to run alongside the UI
* threading is used to run GrantDownloader and ensure both processes end before merging.
* my_button holds the parameters of the confirm button
* Line 279 ends the UI loop
* dateRangeOne and Two converts the date format of the DateEntry to a date.time object to a string using strftime

XML Parsing/Grant Generation

* Creates xmltree object to store the xml information
* Declare a list of agency names (agencyList) and a dictionary to store all grants (grantDictionary)
* Iterate through all grants in the xmltree structure, and create grants objects out of the grants with \<PostDate\> values between the given date range, inclusive. In this loop, we will also call tableOfConents method to add only unique distinctAgency names to agencyList and add any new grant to grantDictionary
* Once the loop ends, we will sort agencyList in order to use it as an ordered key call for our grantDictionary
